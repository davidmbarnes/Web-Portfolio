            <h2>Early Years</h2>

                <p>Born on November 9, 1934, in Brooklyn, New York, Carl Edward Sagan, From nuclear disarmament, to extraterrestrial intelligence, to 'Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,' Carl Sagan was one
                    of the most influential scientists and astronomers of his time. His journey started at the age of five when he would find books about
                    stars in his local library. After attending New York World’s Fair and becoming a fan of science-fiction, his interest in the stars, flying saucers, and
                    astronomy grew substantually. 
                </p>

                <p> After graduating high school in 1951, Carl Sagan attended the University of Chicago at the age of 16 and obtained a Bachelor's of Science in Physics, 
                    and later a Masters in physics also from the University of Chicago. His PH.D. was completed degree in 1960 with his thesis Physical Studies of the Planets 
                    submitted to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

                <p>
                    With his fascination for alien life growing, he worked as a fellow of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, where he helped a 
                    team develop an infrared radiometer for NASA’s Mariner 2 robotic probe. In 1968, he was named director of Cornell’s Laboratory for Planetary Studies, 
                    and three years later, he became a full professor.

                    creatures resembling “gas bags” live high in Jupiter's atmosphere.
                    He also testified before Congress during this period about UFOs and proposed terraforming Venus into a habitable world.
